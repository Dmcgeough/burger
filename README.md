# burger
This was easily one of the most difficult assignments we had ever used. Using the CRUD, template and the MVC paradigm, we created a way to display and devour burgers on an online web browser. We had to create a controller, model and views pages to handle the display of the burgers and the way to devour them. We had Create, Remove, Update and Delete functionality pervading the entire assignment and allowing us to describe and input burgers that after clicking the devour button the corresponding burger would move from one side of the page to the other and become greyed out representing that it had been devoured. It was simple display style but the backend working was a bear to design.
Tools used: Node.js, App.js, MVC paradigm, Routers, APIs, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, ORM, NPM packages.
